# landing-page-cafe
A little project with a landing project for a tea / cafe shop.

Used this little project from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineering Course to get a grip of the web development basics again.
Took around 3-4 hours to complete total as I had to adapt to how Flexbox and CSS in general treats some stuff, but redoing it now I'd get it done faster, so that's exactly what I was aiming for - get a feeling for it again.

Thought I might upload it, will probably make it more interactive, use some smooth scrolling anchor tags for the links within the header and will create some additional pages for it. Will update it, might fork it from here. Feel free to take a look if you're doing the same exercise and might want to check out someone else's solution.
